## Welcome!

## Recommended: [Click here](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffirasm%2Faltair_talk&urlpath=tree%2Faltair_talk%2FLecture.ipynb) to download the lecture notes and code along!

The link above will direct you to ubc.syzygy.ca and ask you to authenticate via your CWL. If this is your first time using syzygy, you may have to click on the link twice (apologies)!

## Backup: using google authentication

If you cannot get CWL authentication to work, you can try using [this link](https://pims.syzygy.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffirasm%2Faltair_talk&urlpath=tree%2Faltair_talk%2FLecture.ipynb&branch=master) to authenticate with a Google Account

## Teaching technology stack

- Code is running in a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org)
- Langauge of code used is Python
- "Slide" view of the notebook is made possible with a jupyter notebook extension: [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). This turns a notebook into a [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/)-based presentation
- "Side by side" notebook cells is possible with another notebook extension: split-cell. Instructions for installing extensions [here](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
- RISE slide customizations are made using CSS in the Lecture.css file
- Polls are done using sli.do but others can also work as the polling interface is embedded into a IFrame.
